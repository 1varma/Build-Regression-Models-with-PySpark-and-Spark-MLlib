# Learn to Build Regression Models with PySpark and Spark MLlib

This repository contains a comprehensive guide to building and deploying regression models using PySpark and Spark MLlib. The project demonstrates step-by-step processes for implementing various types of regression, including Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, and Random Forest Regression.

## Overview

This project focuses on supervised learning techniques for regression analysis using Spark MLlib. Each regression method follows a series of standardized steps:

- **Data Cleaning**: Removing or imputing missing values and removing irrelevant data.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Transforming raw data into suitable formats for modeling.
- **Feature Vectorization**: Converting input features into vector format.
- **Train-Test Data Splitting**: Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets.
- **Model Training**: Building and training the model using the training set.
- **Model Testing**: Evaluating the model’s performance on the test set.
- **Summary**: Summarizing the results and interpreting the model performance.

## Dependencies

To run this project, you'll need:

- Python 3.x
- Apache Spark
- PySpark
- Pandas
- NumPy

### Installing Spark and PySpark

Follow the official Apache Spark installation guide: [Apache Spark Installation](https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html).

### Installing Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install pandas numpy pyspark
```

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/1varma/Build-Regression-Models-with-PySpark-and-Spark-MLlib.git
cd Build-Regression-Models-with-PySpark-and-Spark-MLlib
```

### 2. Running the Notebooks

Launch Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab to open any of the `.ipynb` files and execute the cells step-by-step.

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## Project Structure

- **Data Cleaning**: Clean raw data for consistent modeling.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Apply necessary transformations to make data suitable for ML models.
- **Model Training**: Train each regression model on the training dataset.
- **Model Testing**: Assess the model's performance and accuracy on the test data.

## Usage

Each notebook provides detailed explanations of the following types of regression models:

- **Simple Linear Regression**: Suitable for predicting a target variable based on one predictor.
- **Multiple Linear Regression**: Suitable for predicting a target variable based on multiple predictors.
- **Random Forest Regression**: Suitable for handling complex, non-linear data relationships.

## Results

After running each notebook, you’ll receive a summary of the model's performance. The summary includes key metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-Squared (R²) values.
